Hey, my names Sam.

I am a computer programmer that works to develop health software and support both public and private healthcare initiatives.
Creating and using technology to benefit humans is important to me, and I see health IT and health software as the best way to do that.

After getting my Bachelors in Computer Science, I went to work at Oracle Health when it was still called Cerner.
I cut my teeth on health software there supporting and developing their EHR solutions and bedside medical device interfacing, eventually supporting the MHS Genesis EHR, working with VA and DoW hospitals.
At MITRE I served on the Public Health Systems Innovation Team while contributing to federally funded research and development projects.
