Hey, I'm Sam.

I am a computer programmer that develops health software to support both public and private healthcare initiatives.
Creating and enabling technology to benefit humans is important to me, and I see health software and health IT as the best way to do that.
Beyond researching and harnessing the most cutting edge technology to benefit health, it is the intersection of human health and computers that I am most passionate about. 

After getting my Bachelors in Computer Science, I went to work at Oracle Health when it was still called Cerner.
I cut my teeth on health software there supporting and developing their EHR solutions and bedside medical device interfacing.
I eventually started supporting the MHS Genesis EHR, working with VA and DoW hospitals which sparked a desire to do more to support our government in a way that directly used my skills and background.
At MITRE I served on the Public Health Systems Innovation Team while contributing to federally funded research and development projects.
