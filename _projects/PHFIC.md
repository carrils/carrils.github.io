The [21st Century CURES act](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification) 
outlines health information technology standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria.

The standards and specifications adopted in [45 CFR 170.215](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-170.215) 
aimed to facilitate the interoprability and exchange of health information. These specific technologies include: <br />
* HL7® FHIR Release 4.0.1
* United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) STU 6.1.0
* SMART App Launch Implementation Guide Release 2.0.0
* FHIR® Bulk Data Access STU 1

This project prototyped a public-private partnership between state, tribal, and local (STLT) health departments, MITRE, 
and CDC to demonstrate FHIR messaging capabilities. It provided training by grouping municipal and state HDs to work together to 
develop FHIR client and server software along with supporting tools like Inferno Test Kits to ensure compliance to an IG
as well as planning and building implementation guides to adhere to in the transmisison of data.

Project Contributions
======
My role on the project was to be a staff developer and individual contributor that supported the technical lead in the task of teaching and demonstrating FHIR software. 
Some of the things I did on my time in the project include:
* Helped design and demonstrate functional reference implementations of new FHIR implementation guides
* Designed and implemented testing methodology netween a fhir client and a server with state and local HDs
* Created documentation to assist in teaching how to develop this software for a health department
* Researched existing OTS solutions that may fit a health departments desired use case
