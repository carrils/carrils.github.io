we got a bunch of pipo together from STLT health departments from a bunch of cities and states and then had them do team projects setting up fhir messaging between client and servers.
it was cool. 
i helped them all out setting their stuff up :D


Current status of the collab
======
it was axed when doge came and ruined everything by deleting vital contracts and funding for cutting edge healthcare research which i really though was something we could all get behind but i guess i was just naive?
