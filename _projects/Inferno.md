[Inferno](https://inferno.healthit.gov) is an open source tool/framework for creating, executing and sharing automated conformance tests for the FHIR Standard. 
Inferno tests are packaged in executable Test Kits, which target requirements provided by FHIR Implementation Guides.
You can search if a FHIR Implementation Guide has a Test Kit by searching for the IG in the [repository](https://inferno.healthit.gov/test-kits/).

The project at MITRE focused on creating and maintaining the Inferno Test Kits for ONC/ASTP.
The project team was a small and focused team of Ruby developers and contained few personnel with non-technical contributions.
