[Hospital Price Transparency](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency) 
is an initiative by CMS that helps people know the price of services and items from hospitals before you receive them.

The project at MITRE aimed to support and advise leadership at the Center for Medicare (CM) within CMS in the implementation
of the Hospital Price Transparency final rule, [45 CFR part 180](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-E/part-180).
